## Description
This website is designed to facilitate conversation between classmates at CSUMB. There are message boards for specific classes where users can post questions or announcements, and other users can respond. Users can search classes by subject, class number, and title. Users can also add a class to "my classes" and it can be accessed more quickly in the future. The admin account can add, remove, and edit classes.
